## From massive data to new knowledges
<div style="text-align: right"> 
The contribution of bioinformatics has brought many discoveries to light.
I've always had a passion for new technologies and science in general.
My curiosity has enabled me to develop in the scientific field and to set up a personal project as part of my thesis.
This research project focuses on the invasion of transposable elements in pathogenic fungi (belonging to the order Pucciniales). The aim is to understand how such elements impact on the genomes of pathogens and how they may have had an impact on their constant adaptations to changing climatic conditions and the induction of defence mechanisms by the organisms they infect.
